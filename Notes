Add Match.java to tie SinglesMatch, DoublesMatch, MixedDoublesMatch tightly together so the three (singeles,doubles,mix) only need 
the updateRating() method. Make sure you don't affect how the class calculates (don't mess up the formula) - still gets the 
same player, same rating etc. 
May need to have some classes/some way to differentiate between singlesTeam, doublesTeam, mixedDoublesTeam.
Perhaps make test cases and run them through current program, edit program with abstract Match class,then run test cases through again. 
if the results are the same, commit and push.
